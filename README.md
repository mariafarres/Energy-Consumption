## Energy Consumption for Smart Homes - Project Description 

**Task goal:** build predictive models to forecast future electricity consumption in Smart Homes and demonstrate the client how data can be used to help households make decisions regarding power usage. 

**Data characteristics:** a multivariate time series containing power usage records of a Smart Home. The data was collected between December 2006 and November 2010 and observations of power consumption within the household were collected every minute

## Technical Approach
**Language used:** R programming

**1. PRE-PROCESSING (DATA QUALITY)**
- Missing values check
- Outliers removal
- Attribute selection: correlation plot & decision tree
- Standarization


**2. MODELLING**
- Linear Model
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Trees

**3. ERROR ANALYSIS**
- Absolute and relative errors
- PREDICTION AND VISUALIZATION
**Visualization tool: ggplot
